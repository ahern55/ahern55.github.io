      This section of the shield represents both the beauty of the world and Achilles' immense powers.
      The shield has depictions of the Earth, the sky, and the sea; hence he has support from the major Gods in his quest.
      <br/><br/>
      Overall, this ring begins the theme throughout the rest of the rings of the beauty of our world. The shield starts to emphasize that
      war is not the only state of the world, and that there is beauty to be found in peacetime.
      <br/><br/>
      The pungent imagery of the "inexhaustible blazing sun" and "a plunge in the Ocean's baths" help stress the beauty of Achilles' shield among the atrocities of the war that surrounds him.

        And he forged on the shield two noble cities filled
        with mortal men. With weddings and wedding feasts in one
        and under glowing torches they brought forth the brides
        from the women's chambers, marching through the streets
        while choir on choir the wedding song rose high
        and the young men came dancing, whirling round in rings
        and among them flutes and harps kept up their stirring callwomen
        rushed to the doors and each stood moved with wonder.
        <br/><br/>
        And the people massed, streaming into the marketplace
        where a quarrel had broken out and two men struggled
        over the blood-price for a kinsman just murdered.
        One declaimed in public, vowing payment in full. the
        other spurned him, he would not take a thing so
        both men pressed for a judge to cut the knot.
        The crowd cheered on both, they took both sides,
        but heralds held them back as the city elders sat
        on polished stone benches, forming the sacred circle,
        grasping in hand the staffs of dear-voiced heralds,
        and each leapt to his feet to plead the case in turn,
        Two bars of solid gold shone on the ground before them,
        aprize for the judge who'd speak the straightest verdict.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <div class="scrollable interpretation-section hidden">
      The top half of the second ring depicts a city in peacetime. Readers witness jubilant weddings and feasts in the streets. 
      People are seen dancing and singing and overall enjoying themselves.
      <br/><br/>
      The section also depicts a dispute between a few of the citizens of the city. Instead of the conflict leading to a war, 
      it is taken to court, in front of a "judge who'd speak the straightest verdict."
      <br/><br/>
      The dispute being settled in court is important because it draws a sharp contrast to how disputes are settled during wartime. 
      As the opposing partites are headed to court, "the crowd cheered on both." Clearly, even the quarrel over a quite serious topic
      cannot break the spirits of the city.
      <br/><br/>
      Overall, this section of the shield is meant to depict the joys of peacetime. Of course, this contrasts both Achilles' current situation
      and the bottom half of the second ring of his shield.

        But circling the other city camped a divided army
        gleaming in battle-gear, and two plans split their ranks:
        to plunder the city or share the riches with its people,
        hoards the handsome citadel stored within its depths,
        But the people were not surrendering, not at all.
        <br/><br/>
        They armed for a raid, hoping to break the siege loving
        wives and innocent children standing guard
        on the ramparts, flanked by elders bent with age
        as men marched out to war. Ares and Pallas led them.
        both burnished gold, gold the attire they donned, and great,
        magnificent in their armor-gods for all the world,
        looming up in their brilliance, towering over troops.
        <br/><br/>
        And once they reached the perfect spot for attack,
        a watering place where all the herds collected,
        there they crouched, wrapped in glowing bronze.
        Detached from the ranks, two scouts took up their posts,
        the eyes of the army waiting to spot a convoy,
        the enemy's flocks and crook-homed cattle coming
        Come they did, quickly, two shepherds behind them,
        playing their hearts out on their pipes-treachery
        never crossed their minds. But the soldiers saw them,
        rushed them. cut off at a stroke the herds of oxen
        and sleek sheep-flocks glistening silver-gray
        and killed the herdsmen too. Now the besiegers,
        soon as they heard the uproar burst from the cattle
        as they debated, huddled in council, mounted at once
        behind their racing teams, rode hard to the rescue.
        <br/><br/>
        arrived at once, and lining up for assault
        both armies battled it out along the river banks they
        raked each other with hurtling bronze-tipped spears.
        And Strife and Havoc plunged in the fight, and violent Deathnow
        seizing a man alive with fresh wounds, now one unhurt,
        now hauling a dead man through the slaughter by the heels,
        the cloak on her back stained red with human blood.
        So they clashed and fought like living, breathing men
        grappling each other's corpses, dragging off the dead.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <div class="scrollable interpretation-section hidden">
      This section of the shield stands in clear contrast to the upper portion of the second ring.
      The section actually begins grand and honorable; as the army lines up to siege the city, they wore golden armor, and
      they were supported by "gods for all the world, looming up in their brilliance, towering over troops."
      <br/><br/>
      The situation quickly worsens, though; the shield has graphic imagery of the atrocities of war. Instead of being an easy, clean
      surrender by the sieged city, there is a brutal fight. The armies "clashed and fought like living, breathing men grappling each other's
      corpses, dragging off the dead."
      <br/><br/>
      This violent imagery further stresses war's terrible nature. Instead of orderly conflicts like the proceeding on the upper half of the shield,
      readers witness scenes of humans and animals being slaughtered due to the greed of the army.

        And he forged a fallow field, broad rich plowland
        tilled for the third time, and across it crews of plowmen
        wheeled their teams, driving them up and back and soon
        as they'd reach the end-strip, moving into the turn,
        a man would run up quickly
        and hand them a cup of honeyed, mellow wine
        as the crews would turn back down along the furrows,
        pressing again to reach the end of the deep fallow field
        and the earth churned black behind them, like earth churning,
        solid gold as it was-that was the wonder of Hephaestus' work.
        <br/><br/>
        And he forged a king's estate where harvesters labored,
        reaping the ripe grain, swinging their whetted scythes.
        Some stalks fell in line with the reapers, row on row,
        and others the sheaf-binders girded round with ropes,
        three binders standing over the sheaves, behind them
        boys gathering up the cut swaths, filling their arms,
        supplying grain to the binders, endless bundles.
        And there in the midst the king,
        scepter in hand at the head of the reaping-rows,
        stood tall in silence, rejoicing in his heart.
        And off to the side, beneath a spreading oak,
        the heralds were setting out the harvest feast,
        they were dressing a great ox they had slaughtered,
        while attendant women poured out barley, generous,
        glistening handfuls strewn for the reapers' midday meal.
        <br/><br/>
        And he forged a thriving vineyard loaded with clusters,
        bunches of lustrous grapes in gold, ripening deep purple
        and climbing vines shot up on silver vine-poles.
        And round it he cut a ditch in dark blue enamel
        and round the ditch he staked a fence in tin.
        And one lone footpath led toward the vineyard
        and down it the pickers ran
        whenever they went to strip the grapes at vintagegirls
        and boys, their hearts leaping in innocence,
        bearing away the sweet ripe fruit in wicker baskets.
        And there among them a young boy plucked his lyre,
        so dear it could break the heart with longing,
        and what he sang was a dirge for the dying year,
        lovely . . . his fine voice rising and falling low
        as the rest followed, all together, frisking, singing,
        shouting, their dancing footsteps beating out the time.

        And he forged on the shield a herd of longhom cattle,
        working the bulls in beaten gold and tin, lowing loud
        and rumbling out of the farmyard dung to pasture
        along a rippling stream, along the swaying reeds.
        And the golden drovers kept the herd in line.
        four in all, with nine dogs at their heels,
        their paws flickering quickly-a savage roarla
        crashing attack-and a pair of ramping lions
        had seized a bull from the cattle's front rankshe
        bellowed out as they dragged him off in agony.
        Packs of dogs and the young herdsmen rushed to help
        but the lions ripping open the hide of the huge bull
        were gulping down the guts and the black pooling blood
        while the herdsmen yelled the fast pack on-no use.
        The hounds shrank from sinking teeth in the lions,
        they balked, hunching close. barking. cringing away.
        <br/><br/>
        And the famous crippled Smith forged a meadow
        deep in a shaded glen for shimmering flocks to graze,
        with shepherds' steadings, well-roofed huts and sheepfolds.
        <br/><br/>
        And the crippled Smith brought all his art to bear
        on a dancing circle, broad as the circle Daedalus
        once laid out on Cnossos' spacious fields
        for Ariadne the girl with lustrous hair.
        <br/><br/>
        Here young boys and girls, beauties courted
        with costly gifts of oxen, danced and danced,
        linking their arms, gripping each other's wrists.
        And the girls wore robes of linen light and flowing,
        the boys wore finespun tunics rubbed with a gloss of oil,
        the girls were crowned with a bloom of fresh garlands.
        the boys swung golden daggers hung on silver belts.
        And now they would run in rings on their skilled feet,
        nimbly, quick as a crouching potter spins his wheel,
        palming it smoothly, giving it practice twirls
        to see it run, and now they would run in rows,
        in rows crisscrossing rows-rapturous dancing.
        A breathless crowd stood round them struck with joy
        and through them a pair of tumblers dashed and sprang,
        whirling in leaping handsprings, leading on the dance.
