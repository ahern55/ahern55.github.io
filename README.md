<h1> Jason Ahern's (old) Personal Portfolio <a href="https://ahern55.github.io">Website</a></h1>

# A new version is available at [jasonahern.com](https://jasonahern.com)

A personal portfolio website; a simple static website hosted with GitHub Pages. Optimized for desktop, servicable on mobile.

Note that this website is not complete, but a work in progress. I may not have much time to consistantly improve it, but I try to keep it updated!

## Libraries Used:

- GSAP -- ScrollTrigger, Timeline
- jQuery
- Bootstrap
- Magnific Popup
- fancyapps -- Fancybox

## Other Tools:

- Photoshop
- GIMP

## Known Issues:

- Page height sizing (using viewport heights) does not work on mobile webkit (Instagram, Twitter browsers, etc.)
- Resume timeline breaks down at certain widths (iPad Air on Chrome, but curiously works well on Safari ðŸ¤”)
- Projects intro picture takes a second to take full screen height on mobile

<p>If you notice any other issues, please let me know! I am pretty busy, and CSS issues can snowball into an time consuming fixes, so I may never get to fixing them. But I do like to keep these issues documented.</p>
