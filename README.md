<h1> Jason Ahern Personal Portfolio <a href="https://jasonahern.com">Website</a></h1>

https://www.jasonahern.com

A personal portfolio website; a simple static website hosted with GitHub Pages. Optimized for desktop, servicable on mobile.

Note that this website is not complete, but a work in progress. I may not have much time to consistantly improve it, but I try to keep it updated!

## Libraries Used:
* GSAP -- ScrollTrigger, Timeline
* jQuery
* Bootstrap
* Magnific Popup
* fancyapps -- Fancybox

## Other Tools:
* Photoshop
* GIMP

## Known Issues:
* Page height sizing (using viewport heights) does not work on mobile webkit (Instagram, Twitter browsers, etc.)
* Resume timeline breaks down at certain widths (iPad Air on Chrome, but curiously works well on Safari ðŸ¤”)
* Projects intro picture takes a second to take full screen height on mobile

<p>If you notice any other issues, please let me know! I am pretty busy, and CSS issues can snowball into an all-day fix, so I may never get to fixing them. But I do like to keep these issues documented.</p>

Please feel free to use any code you find here! 

The out-of-place stylesheet is just a bootstrap isolation I needed when designing https://u.osu.edu/fehescaperoom2021/
