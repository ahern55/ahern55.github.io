A personal portfolio website; a simple static website hosted with GitHub Pages. Optimized for desktop, servicable on mobile.

Note that this website is not complete, but a work in progress. I may not have much time to consistantly improve it, but I try to keep it updated!

## Libraries Used:

Please feel free to use any code you find here! 

The out-of-place stylesheet is just a bootstrap isolation I needed when designing https://u.osu.edu/fehescaperoom2021/
